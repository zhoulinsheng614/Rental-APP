## Code Design and Decisions

***1.***

**Parser and Grammar:**

- It's an Android app adapter for displaying house listings. The data displayed in the RecyclerView driven by the data provided in the `houseList`.

**Design Patterns:**

- **Adapter Design Pattern:** The code implements the Adapter design pattern, which is a structural pattern commonly used in Android development for efficiently binding data to UI components. It allows the RecyclerView to work with the data source (`houseList`) and efficiently populate the UI views.(https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/HouseAdapter.java)
- **Singleton Pattern:** Only a single instance of AVLTreeFactory is created.
- **State Pattern:** Two states for login status of users, 0 for offline and 1 for online
- **Iterator Pattern:** With the help of stack, traverse the AVL tree by hasNest() and next()
- **Observer Pattern:** Once the FBDB changes, all users with a listener will be notified and reload the front page automatically

**Technical Decisions:**

- **Data Binding:** The code uses data binding to connect the data from the `houseList` to the UI elements in the RecyclerView. This decision helps maintain a clean separation of data and UI components.

- **Random Image Selection:** It uses a random image selection from an array of image resources. This provides a variety of visuals for each house listing, making the app more visually appealing. The use of randomization enhances the user experience.

- **Serializable Data Transfer:** To pass data between activities, the code utilizes the `Serializable` interface. While this method works for small data objects, it may not be the most efficient option for larger datasets or complex data structures.

- **Event Handling:** It sets an `OnClickListener` for each item in the RecyclerView. When a user clicks on a house listing, it starts a new activity, `House_Detail_Page`, and passes data related to the selected house along with the random image resource ID (`imageid`). This event handling allows users to view detailed information about a specific house.

***2.***

**House detail page design:**

- **Nested UI:** House detail page uses nested UI design to make the whole able to be rolled and different elements are able to stay in the same line
- **Class based:** House detail page receives a class called house from other page, this can help us to store and show data
- **Realtime interaction with database** The number of likes is saved in real time to make others users able to see updated likes when they enter the page.

<hr>

### Data Structures

*I used the following data structures in my project:*

1. *List*
    * *Objective: Sometimes we need to load data from FBDB but it is not used for search. We only display them in Home Fragment. Or we need list to display them in the recycle view to show searching results and sort them by likes received.*
    * *Code Locations: processed using [adapter = new RecyclerView.Adapter<RecyclerView.ViewHolder>()](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/ui/home/HomeFragment.java#L172) and [Search results](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/ui/home/HomeFragment.java#L323-330)
    * *Reasons:*
        * *On the front page we don't need to search by price.*
        * *Since firebase database is a linear structure, if we want to read data from there, we need to load data one by one and form a list in memory first* 

2. *AVL Tree *
    * *Objective: used for storing, sorting and search accounts and houses for basic feature.*
    * *Code Locations: defined in [AccountTree](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/AccountTree.java) and [HouseTree](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/HouseTree.java) and used in [Class Login](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/LogIn.java#L47-85), [Class AccountDelete](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/AccountDelete.java#L52-98) and [PriceSearch](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/ui/home/HomeFragment.java#L281-291)
    * *Reasons:*
        * *It is more efficient than linear Arraylist for searching with a time complexity O(h) ,where h means the height of AVL tree and we can use binary search.*
        * * The relationship among different objects is clear because they are sorted by price.

3. *Map*
    * *Objective: used for uploading new houses*
    * *Code Locations: processed using [Class GalleryFragment](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/ui/gallery/GalleryFragment.java#L186-196)
    * *Reasons:*
        * *The data structure of each house in FBDB is <key, value> where key is the timesatamp of upload time and values are in a string splited by ';'. *
        * *We insert it in a map and then push the map into database*

<hr>

### Design Patterns

1. *State Pattern*
   * *Objective: Login status of a user, 0 for offline and 1 for online.*
   * *Code Locations: defined in [Class Account](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/Account.java#L11); processed in [Activity Login](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/LogIn.java#L70-75) and [Activity Main_Page, method logOut](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/Main_Page.java#L287-320)
   * *Reasons:*
      * We want to guarantee that any account can only be logged on one device to avoid interruption of actions.
      * Once logged in, the status becomes 1 and after signing out, it becomes 0 and this account can be logged in elsewhere.
2. *Singleton Pattern*
    * *Objective: Only one instance of AVLTreeFactory is created. Firebase database is also an application of Singleton.*
    * *Code Locations: defined in [Class AVLTreeFactory](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/AVLTreeFactory.java#L13) ; processed in [Activity Login](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/LogIn.java#L56-58) and [Fragment Home, method applySearch(View v)](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/ui/home/HomeFragment.java#L281-283), as well as anywhere we load from and reload to FB database.
    * *Reasons:*
        * We want to guarantee that only one instance is created.
3. *Iterator Pattern*
    * *Objective: Use stack to traverse AVL tree, not by recursion.*
    * *Code Locations: defined in [Class AccountTree](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/AccountTree.java#L229-285) and [class HouseTree](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/HouseTree.java#L136-190); processed using [Activity AccountDelete](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/AccountDelete.java#L83) and [Fragment Home, method applySearch(View v)](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/ui/home/HomeFragment.java#L289-290)
    * *Reasons:*
        * After deletion of a node in Account Tree, we need to transform it to raw data strings ready to store them back to FB database, so we need to visit all accounts in this AVL tree.
        * When searching for houses, we first construct the AVL tree for houses. If price is not detected by Tokenizer and Parser, then we transform them to a list so that we can search by district and size because this House AVLTree is sorted by prices. 
4. *Observer Pattern*
   * *Objective: Notify and trigger immediate and automatic reloading of houses in Home Fragment.*
   * *Code Locations: defined in FB database; processed in [Fragment Home, Listener addValueEventListener(new ValueEventListener(){})](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/ui/home/HomeFragment.java#L342-383)
   * *Reasons:*
       * It belongs to the LoadShowData Feature. Once the content of database in our House dir changes, like someone likes or updates a new house, any user who is linked to the database reference is notified and the method onChanged() is triggered, then the front page of current user is reloaded with a toast message showing.

### Parser

### <u>Grammar(s)</u>
Production Rules:

- `<SearchQuery> ::= <Location> <PriceRange> <Bedrooms>`
- `<Location> ::= "location" ":" <SuburbName>`
- `<PriceRange> ::= "price" ":" <MinimumPrice> "-" <MaximumPrice>`
- `<Bedrooms> ::= "bedrooms" ":" <Number>`
- `<SuburbName> ::= "Suburb" | "Kingston" | "Braddon" | ... (and other valid Suburb names)`
- `<MinimumPrice> ::= <Number>`
- `<MaximumPrice> ::= <Number>`
- `<Number> ::= <digit>+ (representing an integer)`


### <u>Tokenizers and Parsers</u>

Tokenizers and parsers are used in the `TokenParse` class( https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/TokenParse.java ) to extract and process information from user input in the context of a real estate app. They play a critical role in interpreting the user's search criteria, including location, price range, and the number of bedrooms.

*Location Extraction*

The `extractLocation` method (https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/TokenParse.java#L31-150 )tokenizes the input and identifies the location specified by the user. It employs regular expressions to check for the presence of alphabetic characters in the input. If a location is identified, it is assigned to the `location` field of the `TokenParse` class.

Advantages:
- Robust identification of location based on patterns.
- Flexibility to recognize various location names.

*Price Range Extraction*

The `extractMinMaxPrice` method (https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/TokenParse.java#L159-195 )tokenizes the input to identify the minimum and maximum price values. It handles different input formats, including hyphen-separated ranges and single price values with context. The extracted price range is stored as a list in the `priceRange` field.

Advantages:
- Versatile recognition of price ranges.
- Adjustment of the range for input values greater than 100.

*Bedrooms Extraction*

The `extractBedrooms` method (https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/TokenParse.java#L197-210) tokenizes the input to identify the number of bedrooms specified by the user. It extracts numeric values representing the number of bedrooms and assigns the result to the `bedrooms` field.

Advantages:
- Accurate identification of the number of bedrooms.

## Implemented Features

### Basic Features
1. [LogIn]. LogIn page is used in this app, only users with right password can log in (easy)
   * Code: [Class LogIn, methods applyLogin, onCreate](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/LogIn.java#L32) and [relative UML](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_log_in.xml)
   * Description of feature: 500 user data including username and password are saved in firebase, only these users can access our app through LogIn. <br>
   * Description of your implementation: We store user data in firebase and retrieve data to verify if the entered user data is available and let user get to main page if it's correct, toast user doesn't exist otherwise. <br>

2. [DataFiles]. We feed app 500 user data and 2278 houses data with some attributes, data is all saved in firebase. Besides, we save our options data of uploading house in local xml file. Besides, we made a like function to help users to like the house, the like data is linked to house and saved in firebase.(easy)
   * Code to the Data File [google-services.json](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/google-services.json), [addressBook.xml](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/assets/addressBook.xml)
   * Link to the Firebase repo: [Firebase repo](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ga-23s2-a5f8f/database/ga-23s2-a5f8f-default-rtdb/data/~2F)
   * [Class GalleryFragment(upload house function)](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/ui/gallery/GalleryFragment.java)

3. [LoadShowData]. We reload our house data from firebase when firebase is updated and backend will upload houses automatically every 30 seconds. Data will be shown if there are any users who uploaded houses or like some houses. Also, we show houses and like information to our users and users are able to see changes if these changes database is updated.(medium)
   * Code to show and update Data.[Class HomeFragment, Method databaseReference1.addValueEventListener](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/ui/home/HomeFragment.java#L342)
   <br>

4. [Search]. User is able to search according to suburb, price, bedroom number in search bar, we also show some possible results while user is entering to help our users. We use a tokenizer and parser to learn what kinds of houses the user is trying to search in our app. For example, we can enter "Acton 500-600 6 Bedroom" in search bar to find houses with 6 bedrooms which are located in Acton and has price between 500 and 600 dollars per week . (medium)
   * Code:[Class TokenParse](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/TokenParseTest.java),[Class HomeFragment, method applySearch](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/ui/home/HomeFragment.java#L273)

### Conflict Resolution Protocol

Protocols:

Protocol1: When someone is sick, the task of this person will be arranged to other members.

Protocol2: However, it's not reasonable to be sick for a long time, this person's contribution will be reduced if he failed to catch up with other members after recovery.

Protocol3: Group members must attend all meetings where we write codes and design some essential basis of our project, like the properties of each house, UI layout and parameters passed from an activity of a member to another activity of another member.

Protocol4: If we have some disagreements, we need to have meetings to negotiate. We need to ask for tutors or even the lecturer if we can't handle.

Protocol5: If someone fails to meet the initial plan and/or deadlines, he must provide enough reasons to defend himself and propose a clear deadline to finish his assigned part.
